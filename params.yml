# To use pipeline parameters from a yaml file like this one:
#   nextflow run /path/to/mspipe -params-file /path/to/params.yml
#
# note the extra quoting of strings to make Nextflow happy :(
#

# raw files are stored in folder called 'raw_files' to be processed in the Nextflow pipeline
# this folder is present in the directory where nextflow command is invoked

rawFiles: "raw_files/*.{d,raw}"

# here we specify the name of the results folder where outputs of Nextflow pipeline are stored
# this folder gets created in the directory where Nextflow command is invoked

outputDirectory: "./results_CIL" 

# In this example we are processing data with only MS1 information; see details at https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/ for more information on msconvert
# for msconvertArgs3: this argument should be changed to '"peakPicking true 1-2"' for data with MS/MS information

msconvertArgs: "--mzML"
msconvertArgs2: "--filter"
msconvertArgs3: '"peakPicking true 1-"'  

# skyline processing of Hilic ESI- data
# skylineArgs2: this argument points to .sky document and should be changed based on what is being analyzed
# notice the .sky file is stored in a folder called scripts.
